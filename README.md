# Citizen Science and Engineering Academy

The Citizen Science and Engineering Academy (CSEA) is an open community with the mission of uplifting disadvantaged communities and achieving sustainable development through community science and humanitarian engineering.

## Summary

The Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective (SPEC) is currently developing the concept for the academy. SPEC is seeking partners interested in build the capabilities of the academy. If you would like to contribute to the CSEA or sign up to be a student, please create an issue on this repository or email SPEC at info@specollective.org.
